"""Multi-Agent System (MAS) scaffolding.

This package is intentionally lightweight and dependency-free. It provides:
  - agent interfaces (input/output contracts)
  - an event-driven orchestrator skeleton
  - optional adapters to integrate with existing services (RAG, quiz, tutor)

The research design and formal spec is documented in docs/ResearchDesign.md.
